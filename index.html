       <p class="p2-skills">For this project I created an online signup page for a boxing news letter.   The user can sign up with their first name, last name and email and they will be added to a mailing list that is allocated on mailchimp.com. The site is hosted on heroku.com. Made GET requests using the HTTPS module, Parsed using JSON used express to render the website with API Data. Set up the sign up page and then posted the data given to Mailchimp.com's Servers using their APIs, added success and failure pages when user attempts to sign up and their is a failure.  deployed the website using heroku</p>
